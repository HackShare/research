IMPORTANT KEY NOTES

**Running**
--No longer requires sudo permissions to run--
--Add user to group if required: sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu--
bin/run.sh

**rmiregistry**
It is necessary for rmiregistry to be ran in the directory where the source files are located.
This was easily solved by using 'WORKDIR /root/RMI-Example' and running everything we need from there.

**TODO**
Replace Dockerfile ADD by using Volumes instead.
	Current Issues:
		Volume creates directory, but doesn't seem to be copying any files.

Setup RMI-Example as a jar.
