IMPORTANT KEY NOTES

**Running**
--Type: docker-compose up

**rmiregistry**
It is necessary for rmiregistry to be ran in the directory where the source files are located.
This was easily solved by using 'WORKDIR /root/RMI-Example' and running everything we need from there.

**NOTE**
#Did not write a script to dynamically set HelloClient target IP address (this container)
#If there is an issue running, its likely that HelloClient is targetting the wrong IP

Since it appears that everytime we run this, that the IP doesn't change, to attempt to inspect the rmi-impl container's IP address and change the target IP address in ./src/RMI-1/HelloClient.java

Another option to get the ipaddress is to change the command in docker-compose.yml to run 'ifconfig' and just read the IP from there.
